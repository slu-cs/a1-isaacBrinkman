Overall comments on grading questions:

1) Does your site make the information easy to find?
    - Better than the original, but some things could still be easier.
    - The info on early voting seems misplaced on the Voter Requirements page.
    - After finding it, I still have to dig and do some math to find the 2020 early voting dates.
    - I also have to dig to find the 2020 deadlines for registration and absentee voting.

2) Are the pages reasonably structured with HTML?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - Some lists are marked up as paragraphs (in voting.html and registration.html).
    - Some lists that don't contain any navigation are stored in <nav> tags (in absentee.html).

3) Are the pages tolerably styled with Bootstrap?
    - Yes. Looks nice.
